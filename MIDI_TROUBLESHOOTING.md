# MIDI Troubleshooting Guide

## Why Am I Not Receiving MIDI Messages?

### **MOST COMMON ISSUE: MIDI Device Already in Use**

**Windows only allows ONE application to access a MIDI device at a time.**

If your MIDI controller is open in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), Mideej cannot receive messages from it.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Close Your DAW (Recommended for Testing)
1. Close your DAW completely
2. In Mideej, click the ðŸ”„ (Refresh) button
3. Select your MIDI device from the dropdown
4. Click "Connect"
5. Look for the visual MIDI activity indicator in the bottom-left status bar
6. Move a fader/knob on your MIDI controller
7. You should see:
   - A green "MIDI Activity" indicator flash
   - The status message show the MIDI data received

### Option 2: Use Virtual MIDI Ports (For DAW Integration)
1. Install a virtual MIDI port driver like [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)
2. Create a virtual MIDI port
3. Route your DAW's MIDI output to the virtual port
4. Connect Mideej to the virtual port
5. This allows both applications to work simultaneously

## Which Device Should I Choose?

If you see multiple devices like:
- "SMC Mixer"
- "MIDIIN2 (SMC MIXER)"

**Choose the one with "MIDIIN" in the name** - this is the input device.

## How to Tell If It's Working

When Mideej successfully receives MIDI messages, you will see:

1. **Visual Indicator**: A green dot and "MIDI Activity" text in the bottom-left status bar
2. **Status Message**: The center status bar will briefly show the MIDI data (e.g., "ðŸŽµ MIDI CC: Ch0 CC#1 = 64")
3. **Console Output** (if running from command line): MIDI data printed to console

## Testing Steps

1. **Close all other MIDI applications** (DAWs, virtual instruments, etc.)
2. **Refresh MIDI devices** in Mideej
3. **Connect** to the MIDIIN device
4. **Click the settings cog** on Channel 1 to enter mapping mode
5. **Move a fader or knob** on your MIDI controller
6. You should see:
   - Green MIDI activity flash
   - The mapping complete automatically
   - Channel 1 no longer shows "MAPPING..."

## Cancel Mapping Mode

If you enter mapping mode and want to exit without mapping:
- Click the **"Cancel"** button in the bottom status bar (center)
- The red cancel button appears when mapping mode is active

## Still Not Working?

1. Check Device Manager (Windows) - is your MIDI device recognized?
2. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your MIDI controller physically
3. Restart Mideej
4. Check if Windows audio/MIDI services are running
