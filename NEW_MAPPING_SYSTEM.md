# New Hardware-Agnostic Mapping System

## What's New - Major UX Improvement!

The mapping system has been completely redesigned to be **hardware-agnostic**. Instead of auto-detecting control types based on MIDI message patterns, you now:

1. **Choose WHAT you want to map** (Volume, Mute, Solo, Record, Select)
2. **Press ANY hardware control** on your MIDI device
3. **Done!** That control is now mapped to your selected function

This means **ANY MIDI controller will work** - not just Mackie-compatible devices!

## New UI - Mapping Buttons

Each channel now has **5 small icon buttons** on the right side (visible on hover):

| Icon | Function | Maps To | Compatible Hardware |
|------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **🎚** | Volume | Fader or Knob (CC/Pitch Bend) | Any fader, knob, or rotary encoder |
| **🔇** | Mute | Button (Note On/Off) | Any button |
| **🎵** | Solo | Button (Note On/Off) | Any button |
| **⏺** | Record | Button (Note On/Off) | Any button |
| **▶** | Select | Button (Note On/Off) | Any button |

## How to Map Controls

### Example 1: Map Volume Control

1. **Hover over Channel 1** → You'll see 5 icon buttons appear on the right
2. **Click the 🎚 (Volume) button**
3. Channel shows "MAPPING..." and status bar shows: "MAPPING MODE: Move a MIDI control to map to Channel 1"
4. **Move a fader or knob** on your MIDI controller (ANY fader/knob!)
5. **Done!** The control is now mapped to Channel 1's volume

### Example 2: Map Mute Button

1. **Hover over Channel 2** → See the 5 icon buttons
2. **Click the 🔇 (Mute) button**
3. Channel shows "MAPPING..."
4. **Press ANY button** on your MIDI controller
5. **Done!** That button now toggles mute for Channel 2

### Example 3: Map Solo Button

1. **Click the 🎵 (Solo) button** on Channel 3
2. **Press a button** on your controller
3. **Done!** Solo is mapped

## What Each Control Type Does

### ✅ Volume (🎚)
- **Accepts**: MIDI CC messages OR Pitch Bend messages
- **Function**: Controls channel volume (0-100%)
- **Works with**: Faders, knobs, rotary encoders, sliders
- **Feedback**: Sends values back to motorized faders

### ✅ Mute (🔇)
- **Accepts**: MIDI Note On/Off messages
- **Function**: Toggles channel mute state
- **Works with**: Any button
- **LED Feedback**: Lights up when muted, off when unmuted
- **Affects**: All audio sessions assigned to the channel

### ✅ Solo (🎵)
- **Accepts**: MIDI Note On/Off messages
- **Function**: Toggles channel solo (mutes all other channels)
- **Works with**: Any button
- **LED Feedback**: Lights up when soloed
- **Behavior**: Exclusive - only soloed channels play

### ✅ Record (⏺)
- **Accepts**: MIDI Note On/Off messages
- **Function**: Toggles recording indicator for the channel
- **Works with**: Any button
- **LED Feedback**: Lights up when "recording" is on
- **Status**: Shows "Recording: ON/OFF" in status bar

### ✅ Select (▶)
- **Accepts**: MIDI Note On/Off messages
- **Function**: Toggles channel selection state
- **Works with**: Any button
- **LED Feedback**: Lights up when selected
- **Status**: Shows "Selected: ON/OFF" in status bar

## Smart Error Handling

The system now validates that you're pressing the right type of control:

### If You Try to Map Volume with a Button:
```
Status: "Expecting a button press for Volume, but received Note message. Try a fader/knob for Volume mapping."
```

### If You Try to Map Mute with a Fader:
```
Status: "Expecting a button press for Mute, but received CC message. Try a button."
```

This prevents accidental wrong mappings!

## Hardware Compatibility

### Works with ANY MIDI Controller:

✅ **Mackie Control Compatible** (M-Vave SMC8, Behringer X-Touch, etc.)
- Faders send pitch bend → Maps to Volume
- Buttons send notes → Maps to Mute/Solo/Record/Select

✅ **Standard MIDI Controllers** (Akai MPK, Arturia KeyLab, etc.)
- Knobs send CC messages → Maps to Volume
- Pads send notes → Maps to buttons

✅ **MIDI Keyboards**
- Keys send notes → Maps to buttons
- Mod wheel sends CC → Maps to Volume

✅ **DIY Arduino MIDI Controllers**
- Any button/potentiometer → Maps to anything!

✅ **Generic USB MIDI Controllers**
- Just needs to send MIDI CC or Note messages

## New Console Debug Output

When you map a control, you'll see:

```
=== Mapping mode requested for Channel 1 - Control Type: Volume ===
MIDI CC: Ch0 CC#16 Val64
  Mapping CC to Volume
Mapped MIDI CH0 CC16 to Channel 1 Volume
```

When a mapped control is used:

```
MIDI Note On: Ch0 Note#16 Vel127
  Mapping button to: Mute
Mute toggled for Channel 1: True
```

## Comparison: Old vs New System

### Old System (Auto-Detection)
❌ Only worked with Mackie-compatible devices
❌ Had to guess which button you pressed
❌ Note ranges hardcoded (0-7 = Record, 8-15 = Solo, etc.)
❌ Not flexible for different hardware

### New System (User Choice)
✅ Works with ANY MIDI controller
✅ User explicitly chooses what to map
✅ No hardcoded note ranges
✅ Hardware-agnostic design
✅ Clear visual feedback
✅ Error messages if you use wrong control type

## Testing the New System

### Test 1: Map All Controls for One Channel
1. Hover over Channel 1
2. Click 🎚 → Move fader → Volume mapped ✓
3. Click 🔇 → Press button → Mute mapped ✓
4. Click 🎵 → Press button → Solo mapped ✓
5. Click ⏺ → Press button → Record mapped ✓
6. Click ▶ → Press button → Select mapped ✓

### Test 2: Verify Hardware Agnostic
Try mapping with different control types:
- Map Volume to a **knob** (CC message) → Works! ✓
- Map Volume to a **fader** (Pitch Bend) → Works! ✓
- Map Mute to **any button** regardless of note number → Works! ✓

### Test 3: Test Error Handling
1. Click 🔇 (Mute button mapping)
2. Move a fader instead of pressing a button
3. Status shows error message ✓
4. Press a button → Mapping works ✓

   - Added `Record` and `Select` to `MidiControlType` enum

2. **ViewModels/ChannelViewModel.cs**
   - Added `IsRecording` and `IsSelected` properties

   - Updated `EnterMappingMode(string controlType)` to accept control type parameter
   - Added `MappingTypeRequestedEventArgs` for passing control type

3. **ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs**

   - Updated `OnChannelMappingModeRequested` to extract control type
   - Removed auto-detection from `OnMidiNoteOn`
   - Added control type validation in `OnMidiControlChange` and `OnMidiPitchBend`
   - Implemented `Record` and `Select` toggle functionality in `ApplyMidiNote`

4. **Controls/ChannelControl.xaml**

## What's Next?

The mapping system is now complete and hardware-agnostic! You can:

1. **Map any MIDI controller** to any function
2. **Mix and match** different hardware (use keyboard for some controls, faders for others)
3. **Easily remap** by clicking the icon and pressing a different control
4. **See clear feedback** when controls are activated

All mappings persist between sessions and are saved to `AppData\Mideej\appsettings.json`.
