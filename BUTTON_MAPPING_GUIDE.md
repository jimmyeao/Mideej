# Button Mapping Guide

## What's New

I've added full support for mapping all 4 button types on your M-Vave SMC8 controller:
- **Mute** buttons (Notes 16-23)
- **Solo** buttons (Notes 8-15)
- **Record** buttons (Notes 0-7)
- **Select** buttons (Notes 24-31)

## How Button Auto-Detection Works

When you press a button during mapping mode, the app **automatically detects** which type of button it is based on the MIDI note number:

| Button Type | Note Range | Function |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Record** | 0-7 | Placeholder (shows message) |
| **Solo** | 8-15 | Toggles channel solo state |
| **Mute** | 16-23 | Toggles channel mute state |
| **Select** | 24-31 | Placeholder (shows message) |

## How to Map Buttons

### Example: Map Mute Button to Channel 1

1. **Click the settings cog (âš™)** on Channel 1
2. **Press the Mute button** for Channel 1 on your controller (Note 16)
3. Console shows:
   ```
   MIDI Note On: Ch0 Note#16 Vel127
   Auto-detected button type: Mute
   Mapped MIDI CH0 Note16 to Channel 1 Mute
   ```
4. **Mapping complete!** The LED on the button should light up

### Example: Map Solo Button to Channel 2

1. **Click the settings cog (âš™)** on Channel 2
2. **Press the Solo button** for Channel 2 on your controller (Note 9)
3. Console shows:
   ```
   MIDI Note On: Ch0 Note#9 Vel127
   Auto-detected button type: Solo
   Mapped MIDI CH0 Note9 to Channel 2 Solo
   ```
4. **Mapping complete!**

## Button Functionality

### âœ… Fully Implemented

**Mute Button:**
- Toggles channel mute state
- Updates all assigned audio sessions
- Sends LED feedback to controller (LED on when muted)
- Console output: `Mute toggled for Channel 1: True`

**Solo Button:**
- Toggles channel solo state
- Applies solo logic (mutes all non-soloed channels)
- Sends LED feedback to controller (LED on when soloed)
- Console output: `Solo toggled for Channel 1: True`

### ðŸ“‹ Placeholder (To Be Implemented)

**Record Button:**
- Currently shows status message: "Channel 1 - Record button pressed (not yet implemented)"
- Lights up the LED
- Console output: `Record button pressed for Channel 1`
- **Future**: Could be used to arm channels for recording

**Select Button:**
- Currently shows status message: "Channel 1 - Select button pressed (not yet implemented)"
- Lights up the LED
- Console output: `Select button pressed for Channel 1`
- **Future**: Could be used to select/highlight channels for editing

## LED Feedback

The app sends MIDI messages back to your controller to update button LEDs:

- **Mute LED**: ON when channel is muted, OFF when unmuted
- **Solo LED**: ON when channel is soloed, OFF when unsoloed
- **Record LED**: Blinks when pressed (placeholder)
- **Select LED**: Blinks when pressed (placeholder)

## Testing All Button Types

### Test Mute and Solo
1. Map Mute button to a channel â†’ Press it â†’ Channel should mute/unmute
2. Map Solo button to a channel â†’ Press it â†’ Channel should solo (other channels mute)
3. Verify LEDs light up when active

### Test Record and Select (Placeholders)
1. Map Record button â†’ Press it â†’ Status message shows "Record button pressed"
2. Map Select button â†’ Press it â†’ Status message shows "Select button pressed"
3. LEDs should blink briefly

## Complete Mapping Example

Map all controls for Channel 1 (assuming Mackie mode with 1-based indexing):

1. **Fader** (Pitch Bend on MIDI Ch1): Controls volume
2. **Knob** (CC#16): Ready to map to any parameter
3. **Record** (Note 0): Placeholder
4. **Solo** (Note 8): Toggles solo
5. **Mute** (Note 16): Toggles mute
6. **Select** (Note 24): Placeholder

## What Changed

### Files Modified

1. **Models/MidiMapping.cs**
   - Added `Record` and `Select` to `MidiControlType` enum

2. **ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs**
   - Auto-detect button type from note number in `OnMidiNoteOn`
   - Handle `Record` and `Select` in `ApplyMidiNote` switch statement
   - Added debug logging for all button presses

3. **MainWindow.xaml.cs**
   - Added `Closing` event handler to save configuration on exit
   - **Fixes channels disappearing on restart!**

## Configuration Persistence

All button mappings are now automatically saved when you close the app:
- Saved to: `%AppData%\Mideej\appsettings.json`
- Includes fader mappings, button mappings, and channel configurations
- Automatically loaded on startup

## Next Steps

When you're ready to implement Record and Select functionality, you can:
- **Record**: Add channel recording/arming state to `ChannelViewModel`
- **Select**: Add channel selection/highlighting in the UI

For now, the placeholders confirm that the buttons are working and properly mapped!
