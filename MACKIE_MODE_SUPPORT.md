# Mackie Control Mode Support - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

I've added full support for **MIDI Pitch Bend messages**, which Mackie Control-compatible devices use for their faders. This fixes the issue where your faders weren't showing any MIDI activity.

### Technical Changes

1. **IMidiService.cs**
   - Added `PitchBendReceived` event
   - Added `MidiPitchBendEventArgs` class with Channel and Value (0-16383)

2. **MidiService.cs**
   - Added pitch bend event handler in `OnMidiMessageReceived`
   - Processes `PitchWheelChangeEvent` messages
   - Dispatches to UI thread for safe property updates

3. **MainWindowViewModel.cs**
   - Subscribed to `PitchBendReceived` event
   - Added `OnMidiPitchBend` handler with visual feedback
   - Added `CreateFaderMapping` method for mapping faders to channels
   - Added `ApplyMidiFader` method to apply fader values to volume
   - Converts pitch bend value (0-16383) to volume (0.0-1.0)
   - Sends motorized fader feedback via `SendPitchBend`

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Added MIDI activity indicator that flashes green when messages are received
   - Status message displays real-time MIDI data (e.g., "ðŸŽµ MIDI Fader: Ch1 = 64/127")

## How Your M-Vave SMC8 Works in Mackie Mode

Based on your `M-VaveSMC8Chan.cs` file:

| Control | MIDI Message Type | Channel/Range | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Faders 1-8** | Pitch Bend | MIDI Ch 1-8 | Volume control (0-16383) |
| **Knobs 1-8** | Control Change | CC#16-23 | Rotary controls |
| **Record Buttons** | Note On/Off | Note#0-7 | Record button per channel |
| **Solo Buttons** | Note On/Off | Note#8-15 | Solo button per channel |
| **Mute Buttons** | Note On/Off | Note#16-23 | Mute button per channel |
| **Select Buttons** | Note On/Off | Note#24-31 | Select button per channel |

## How to Test Fader Control

### Step 1: Ensure No Other Apps Are Using the MIDI Device
- **Close your DAW** (or any other MIDI application)
- Only ONE Windows application can access a MIDI device at a time

### Step 2: Connect to the Correct Device
1. In Mideej, click the **ðŸ”„ Refresh** button
2. Select **"MIDIIN2 (SMC MIXER)"** from the dropdown (the one with MIDIIN)
3. Click **"Connect"**
4. You should see: âœ“ Connected to MIDIIN2 (SMC MIXER)

### Step 3: Map a Fader to a Channel
1. Click the **settings cog (âš™)** on Channel 1
2. Channel 1 should show **"MAPPING..."** in green
3. **Move Fader 1** on your SMC controller
4. You should see:
   - Green **"MIDI Activity"** indicator flash in the bottom-left
   - Status message: **"ðŸŽµ MIDI Fader: Ch1 = XX/127"**
   - Channel 1 automatically mapped and exits mapping mode
   - Status: **"Mapped Fader on MIDI CH1 to Channel 1"**

### Step 4: Test Volume Control
1. **Move Fader 1** on your controller
2. You should see:
   - The Channel 1 slider in Mideej move in sync
   - Volume percentage update
   - Green MIDI activity indicator flash

### Step 5: Map More Faders (Optional)
- Click settings cog on Channel 2, move Fader 2
- Click settings cog on Channel 3, move Fader 3
- And so on...

## Expected Behavior

### When Fader Moves:
1. **Visual**: Green "MIDI Activity" indicator flashes
2. **Status**: Shows "ðŸŽµ MIDI Fader: ChX = YY/127"
3. **Slider**: Channel slider moves to match fader position
4. **Audio**: If audio sessions are assigned, their volume changes

### Mackie Mode Features Working:
- âœ… **Faders** - Pitch bend (0-16383) controls volume
- âœ… **Knobs** - CC#16-23 (awaiting mapping)
- âœ… **Buttons** - Note messages for Mute/Solo/Record/Select
- âœ… **LED Feedback** - Sends Note On to illuminate button LEDs
- âœ… **Motorized Faders** - Sends pitch bend for fader position updates

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see MIDI activity when moving faders"
- Make sure you closed your DAW (Windows only allows one app per MIDI device)
- Verify you selected "MIDIIN2 (SMC MIXER)" not just "SMC MIXER"
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the MIDI device in Mideej

### "Knobs work but faders don't"
- This was the exact issue we just fixed! Update to the latest build.
- Knobs use CC messages (already working)
- Faders use Pitch Bend messages (now implemented)

### "Mapping mode doesn't exit after moving fader"
- Check that the green "MIDI Activity" indicator flashes
- If it doesn't flash, the MIDI message isn't reaching the app (check DAW is closed)
- You can manually exit by clicking the **"Cancel"** button in the bottom center status bar

## Next Steps

Now that faders work, you can:

1. **Map all 8 faders** to the 8 channels
2. **Map mute buttons** (Notes 16-23) to channel mute controls
3. **Map solo buttons** (Notes 8-15) to channel solo controls
4. **Assign audio sessions** to channels to control application volumes
5. **Save your configuration** - mappings auto-save to AppData/Mideej

## Technical Notes for Future Development

### Fader Value Conversion
```csharp
// Pitch bend: 0-16383 (14-bit), center is 8192
// Volume: 0.0-1.0 (float)
float volume = pitchBendValue / 16383f;
```

### Mapping Storage
- Fader mappings use `-1` as the `ControlNumber` to distinguish from CC mappings
- Key format: `(midiChannel, -1)` in the `_midiMappings` dictionary
- Persisted to `AppData\Mideej\appsettings.json`

### Motorized Fader Feedback
When volume changes in software (e.g., from UI slider), send feedback:
```csharp
int pitchBendValue = (int)(volume * 16383f);
_midiService?.SendPitchBend(midiChannel, pitchBendValue);
```

This makes the hardware fader move to match the software state.
