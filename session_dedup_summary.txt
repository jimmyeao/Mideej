DEEJNG SESSION DEDUPLICATION - QUICK REFERENCE

KEY CONCEPT: DeejNG deduplicates MULTIPLE SESSIONS FROM SAME PROCESS at the UI level using 
a HashSet<string> that tracks friendly names (process names).

DEDUPLICATION MECHANISM (MultiTargetPickerDialog.LoadSessions):
- Initializes HashSet<string> with {"system", "unmapped"}
- Loops through ALL audio sessions
- For each session:
  1. Gets process ID
  2. Extracts friendly name via Process.GetProcessById + ProcessName
  3. Checks: if (seenProcesses.Contains(friendlyName)) SKIP
  4. Otherwise: Add to UI and mark as seen

RESULT: Spotify with 3 sessions shows as ONE entry to user

PROCESS NAME EXTRACTION (AudioUtilities.GetProcessNameSafely):
- Uses Process.ProcessName (NOT MainModule which throws for UWP)
- Caches results in Dictionary<int, string>
- Cleans cache every 60 seconds, max 30 entries
- Skips system processes (PIDs 0,4,8) and PID < 100

SESSION IDENTITY:
- SimpleSessionPicker: Uses GetSessionIdentifier/GetSessionInstanceIdentifier with fallback
- MultiTargetPickerDialog: Uses process name only (lowercase)
- ID stored as: friendlyName.ToLowerInvariant()

SPECIAL ENTRIES:
- "system" (Id="system") - Master volume
- "unmapped" (Id="unmapped") - Catch-all apps
- "current" (Id="current") - Currently focused app (MultiTarget only)

WHEN APPLYING CONTROLS:
- User sets "spotify" volume to 50%
- System finds ALL sessions with process name "spotify"
- Applies 50% to EACH matching session
- Result: ALL Spotify audio streams get 50% volume

KEY FILES:
- DeejNG/Dialogs/MultiTargetPickerDialog.xaml.cs (lines 237-364) - LoadSessions deduplication
- DeejNG/Classes/AudioUtilities.cs - GetProcessNameSafely with caching
- DeejNG/Classes/AudioService.cs - ApplyVolumeToTarget with loop through all sessions

ADVANTAGES:
- Simple for users (no session IDs)
- Multiple instances controlled together
- Robust to session recreation

DISADVANTAGES:
- Can't control individual sessions from same app
- No indication to user that multiple sessions exist
